    <h1>Welcome to the KTH IPT website!</h1>

    <h2>What is the IPT?</h2>

    <p class="ipt_description">
      The IPT is an international university-level tournament for bachelor’s and
      master’s students with an interest in physics! It was started in 2009, and
      today teams from over 20 countries participate each year. Unlike the math
      or physics olympiads you may know about, the IPT is a team effort where
      you and your teammates collaborate for over six months. You combine
      theoretical and experimental physics to solve open research-oriented
      physics problems, culminating with a one-week tournament where all teams
      gather and present their solutions. This year, the IPT is hosted by Poland
      in Warzaw. During most of the IPT, however, you will be working on
      problems at KTH. This helps you improve skills such as experimental
      physics, analytical ability, collaboration and understanding of physics
      research in general. And of course, you get to know people with a similar
      interest in physics! Each year 17 problems are announced on the IPT
      website: <a href="https://iptnet.info/">https://iptnet.info/</a> Here you
      can also find some more useful in-depth information about the IPT. Working
      on IPT problems is an interesting experience because they are open, and
      generally impossible to solve completely or even partially. One often
      needs to combine many strategies such as:
    </p>
    <ul class="ipt_description_list">
      <li><p>Experimental work</p></li>
      <li><p>Building experiments</p></li>
      <li><p>Mathematical modelling</p></li>
      <li><p>Numerical simulations</p></li>
      <li><p>Machine learning</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ipt_description">
      Our goal is of course to solve as many problems as possible. As a
      participant, you will be in a team of 2-3 people working on any given
      problem. Often you need to work on more than one problem. The IPT is also
      offered as a 7.5 hp course (SA1005).

    <h2>How do I join?</h2>

    <p class="ipt_description">
      In case you think any of this sounds interesting, you can show your
      interest by filling
      <span class="ipt_join_link_text"
        ><a
          class="ipt_join_link"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://forms.gle/isTC2ptbGH1C3My7A"
          >this google forms</a
        ></span
      >. If neccessary there will be a selection for the team were you will be
      asked to solve/present solution-ideas for some simple problem. You will
      then be invited to an information meeting were we will describe the
      process in more depth. A preliminary date for the information meeting is
      the 10th september 17.30 in Alba Nova building at KTH.
