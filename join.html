    <h1>Joining the IPT</h1>

    <h2>Who are we looking for?</h2>
    We are looking for more or less anyone with a keen interest in physics.
    You only need to be a master’s or bachelor’s student in some STEM field.
    It is great if you have experience with some of the concepts listed
    above, but not necessary. A reasonable solution often involves a large
    time commitment, and getting stuck at various points along the way to
    get there. Thus, you must be able to spend this time but also be
    committed enough to overcome unexpected challenges. You don’t need to be
    a Swedish student either. We are happy to welcome international students
    to the team!
    <h2>What is expected from me?</h2>
    If you choose to join the team, we expect that you invest time in trying
    to solve the problems. A ballpark figure is at least 3-5 h / week but
    this could vary depending on how much experience you have. There will be
    weekly or biweekly meetings which you should try to attend whenever you
    can. We don’t expect any work to be done around exam periods, and we
    have an understanding that it sometimes will be hard to work this much
    due to other reasons. Progress is important, but not everything. We will
    offer support whenever you get stuck, which will happen with these
    problems. The openness of the IPT problems is what makes them
    interesting in the first place, but it also makes them impossible to
    solve completely and sometimes incredibly hard to solve partially.
    Therefore you must stay motivated, and try to make the most of the
    situation. Identifying the parts of the problem you understand and work
    with that.
