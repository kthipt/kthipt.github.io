        <h3>1. Rip fast</h3>

        <p class="problem_description">
          Is it possible to tell how fast a sheet of paper has been torn into
          two pieces by examining its torn edges? Investigate how the edge
          patterns depend on the tearing dynamics and the kind of paper that is
          used. What types of paper give the largest and smallest estimation
          uncertainty in the tearing speed?

          <p class="problem_description">
            When honey is dripping from a spoon, the trickle can stop flowing,
            oscillate up and down before flowing again. Explain the phenomenon.
            Investigate how the oscillations depend on the relevant parameters.

        <h3>3. Oscillating rings</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Take two ferromagnetic rings of different radii and tie them by a
          string. Connect another string to the larger ring at the same point.
          Now holding the whole construction by the second string, you can
          suspend it in the air by a magnet placed above (see link below). Being
          held only by these vertical strings, the rings are free to rotate
          around the vertical axis. Investigate their rotational motion based on
          the parameters of the system (magnetic permeability of the rings,
          moments of inertia, positions, thickness, etc). What happens if you
          replace the central ring with a disk?

        <p class="problem_description">
          Under certain circumstances a flame can travel along an open canal
          (see link below). Explain the phenomenon. Investigate its lifetime and
          speed. Under which circumstances does it display a periodic behavior?
          Maximize the lifetime of a traveling flame for a given amount of fuel.

        <h3>5. Flying coin</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          One can make a coin fly from a table into a plate placed on it by
          blowing on it from a certain angle. Investigate the movement of the
          coin and how it depends on the relevant parameters. What is the
          maximum height of the plate’s edge such that the coin still lands
          on/in it? Can you predict the face on which the coin lands based on
          the relevant parameters?

        <p class="problem_description">
          Maximize the luminosity of a candle by varying its size and shape for
          a chosen wick. What shape should it have to ensure that, when the wick
          has fully burnt out, all the wax has also completely vaporized away?

        <h3>7. Tea stripes</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          When looking on the surface of hot tea, over time a stripe formation
          can be seen. Explain the phenomenon and estimate the characteristic
          time of pattern formation and stripe size. Hint: Usually, this
          phenomenon is observed when using hard water for tea.

        <h3>8. Kelvin dropper</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          A reservoir containing a conducting liquid is connected to two hoses
          that release two falling streams of drops, which land in two
          containers. Each stream passes through a metal ring or open cylinder
          which is electrically connected to the opposite receiving container.
          After a while, a spark may be observed between two conducting rods
          connected to the setup. Use this setup as an electrical generator.
          Investigate and optimize its power efficiency.

        <h3>9. Chaotic laces</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          If a sufficiently large number of shoelaces is rotated in a centrifuge
          with water - similar to a washing machine - the laces become
          entangled. Investigate the number of knots in a single lace, as well
          as knots between different laces. Study the length distribution of the
          longest resultant rope that can be formed as a function of the number
          of laces and their individual length?

        <p class="problem_description">
          When a magnetic ring is left at the top of a ferromagnetic rod,
          several types of motion can be observed. Under which conditions does
          each type of motion appear? Which types of motion lead to the longest
          fall time for a given ring radius?

        <p class="problem_description">
          Under certain circumstances, soap bubbles don’t break when they fall
          on a soft carpet. Investigate this phenomenon. What is the maximal
          landing speed that a bubble can survive for a given carpet?

        <p class="problem_description">
          Estimate the highest possible launch speed of a rubber band using its
          own extension. What is the maximal speed that can be reliably achieved
          over multiple shots with the same rubber band?

        <h3>13. Paper blade</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Investigate the conditions for a paper sheet to cut through different
          materials. What is the strongest material the paper blade can cut
          through?

        <h3>14. Loud bicycle</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Some cyclists attach ratchets made of clothes pegs and plastic plates
          that touch the spokes of a wheel. When the bike is rolling, the plates
          are repeatedly hit by the spokes, causing sound emission. How loud can
          one make this sound? Optimize the setup for a usual bicycle at normal
          speed, while keeping the bicycle operational.

        <h3>15. Creeping salt</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          When concentrated brine (water and dissolved salt) is allowed to
          evaporate in a container, the salt precipitates and forms small
          crystals. But more surprisingly, many crystals form outside the
          container. The salt crawls away from the walls of the container and
          may cover the outer walls or climb up a plunging rod. Explain the
          phenomenon. What is the maximum height that salt crystals can reach on
          the rod? Maximize the amount of salt that can be extracted on the rod
          per unit volume of evaporated solution via this method.

        <h3>16. Pet bottle rocket</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Build your own rocket using a single PET bottle and add any
          modifications you like. The working principle of the rocket should be
          via expulsion, without any combustion or chemical reactions.
          Investigate what are the limits of the height and the speed of such
          rockets.

        <h3>17. The slinky</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          When one places a slinky at the top of a staircase, it can be pushed
          to travel in its peculiar motion down the stairs. Investigate how the
          average slope influences the motion of the slinky. What is the minimal
          average slope such that the slinky successfully reaches its steady
          periodic motion? What happens if you replace the stairs with an
          inclined plane?
