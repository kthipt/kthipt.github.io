        <h3>1. Galton Board</h3>

        <p class="problem_description">
          Dropping a set of beads on a board with evenly distributed pegs
          results in a binomial distribution. Is it possible to generate other
          kinds of distributions by varying some parameters (Pegs size, pegs
          distribution, bead format, etc.)? Is it possible to achieve a
          distribution that does not obey the central limit theorem in an i.i.d.
          scenario? What happens to the distribution when one makes the board
          vibrate?

          <p class="problem_description">
            Given enough angular momentum, a hoop with a mass attached to it may
            demonstrate a jumping motion when it is rolling. Explain the
            phenomenon and how it depends on the relevant parameters. Is it
            possible to reproduce this behavior with any unbalanced mass
            distribution on a wheel? What happens whenonechangestheprofile of
            the ground? Can you add amechanical contraption (that will not touch
            the ground) to the hoop to increase the maximal height of the jump?

        <h3>3. Solenoid resonance</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Consider a helicoidal spring hanging vertically with a mass attached
          to it as a solenoid. If one lets current flow through the spring, it
          creates a magnetic field. How can one influence the motion of the
          spring by changing this current? What happens if we put this system in
          an RLC circuit (where L is our spring) with AC current? What kind of
          resonant phenomena and energy transfer between the mechanical and
          electromagnetic modes can be achieved?

        <h3>4. Alcohol sound check</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Some distilleries in Brazil praise their product’s quality by the
          distinct sound it makes when the bottle is hit after being quickly
          turned upside down. Investigate the phenomenon. Why does the effect
          not work with alcoholic carbonated drinks? What other liquids will
          maintain this “damping” effect for longer?

        <h3>5. PVC cement droplets</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          PVC cement is a material used in plumbing to solder PVC pipes
          together. PVC cementdroplets have been observed to spin when dropped
          in water. Explain the physical mechanisms that cause the peculiar
          motion of the droplets. Study how the shape of the droplets impacts
          their rotation. Can you create droplets that propel across the water
          instead of rotating? Maximize their rotational and translational
          motion. https://youtu.be/38XWz1IL6j8

        <h3>6. Salty shapes</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          In some deserts, such as Death Valley, one can see salt polygons that
          have formed through the evaporation of salty water (https:
          //physics.aps.org/articles/v16/31). Investigate and explain the
          phenomenon. Reproduce the phenomenon in the lab. Which twodimensional
          pattern can one obtain in such an experiment? What is the size of the
          smallest polygon you can obtain?

        <h3>7. Smart water</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          If you let water flow in a maze you end up with a physical
          maze-solving algorithm. Many other algorithms and computations can be
          done with physical systems. Create a water-based computer
          (withoutelectronics) that solves an NP-hard problem.

        <h3>8. Peculiar echo</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          The combination of a clap and the massive pyramid (Chichen Itza,
          Mexico) gives rise to a mysterious sound called “Quetzal tail”, as
          shown in the video. Investigate the phenomenon, find the necessary
          conditions to create it, and reproduce it.

        <h3>9. The bright spot</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          There is a famous phenomenon in wave optics called the Arago-Poisson
          spot where a bright spot is created in the middle of the shadow of a
          spherical object when one shines coherent light on it. By shining the
          light on other types of solids (e.g. cubes, cylinders, etc.) one gets
          different patterns to appear in the shadow of the object. What
          information about the geometry of a solid can be obtained by analyzing
          the pattern in its shadow?

        <h3>10. Bubbles under a wet glass</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          In the right conditions, if a wet glass is turned upside down and put
          on a flat (but not necessarily polished) surface, air bubbles start
          appearing in the bottom part of it. Reproduce and explain the
          phenomenon. Which parameters define the number of bubbles (and lines,
          in which they aggregate) and their lifetime? Can one makeacomplete
          circle of bubbles along the inner wall of the glass?

        <h3>11. The big bang</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          When a balloon explodes, it produces a short loud sound. Can you
          predict the geometry and internal pressure of the exploded balloon
          from the sound of the explosion? Do any external parameters affect the
          sound?

        <h3>12. Pool vortex rings</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          A plate dragged through the surface of still water can produce two
          black circles on the bottom of the pool, which are the shadows of
          vortices on the surface (see the provided video). Analyzing a short
          video of the shadows at some point in time, can you predict how long
          the vortices will last? https://youtu.be/pnbJEg9r1o8
        </p>

      <div class="problem">
        <h3>13. Eggfight</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Egg tapping is a traditional game where two players hold a boiled egg.
          Each player hits the other player’s egg with their own, as shown in
          the video. The player whose egg has cracked loses the game. Devise a
          non-invasive method to predict the winning egg among the given two.
          Improve the prediction with invasive examination methods.

        <h3>14. Unrolling Tape</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          When unrolling a roll of adhesive tape, a loud sound can be produced.
          Explain the physics of the sound emission. Find ways to maximize and
          minimize the noise.

        <h3>15. Anti-bubbles</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Fill a container with water with decreased surface tension. Then drop
          a droplet of regular water into the container (very slowly). The
          droplet will create a so-called “anti-bubble”. Investigate the
          phenomenon. Maximize the size and lifetime of an anti-bubble. Are
          these quantities related? https://youtu.be/w5UMyck8D64

        <h3>16. Pulsar bar</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Construct a mechanical model of a pulsar using a magnet. What
          frequency do you expect your device to radiate at? At what angles
          around the model do you expect the radiation to be detectable? Propose
          a contraption to detect this radiation directly or indirectly.

        <h3>17. Thermal snail</h3>
        <p class="problem_description">
          Make an autonomous device that makes use of thermal expansion to move
          due to daily temperature fluctuations. Your device should work in the
          shade and is not allowed to include any electronics or piezo electric
          elements for transduction. Furthermore, you are not allowed to exploit
          any temperature difference between the device and the surfaceit is on.
          Maximize its speed for a fixed maximum linear dimension of 10 cm and
          your outdoor weather conditions (or equivalent laboratory conditions
          if the outside weather is not suited to the experiment).
